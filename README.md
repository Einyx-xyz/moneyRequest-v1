TylerB's moneyRequest E2 Functions (v1)
==============

These functions were originally written for my friend, CanadianBill, as a request.

With this addon, you can create unhackable stores using Expression 2!

moneyRequest() - Ask someone for money. 
moneyGive() - Give someone your money. 
moneyClk() - Returns 1 when someone hits YES. (Can accept string as input - Returns 1 if the string == the title of the request, 0 otherwise)

moneyNoClk() - Returns 1 when someone hits NO. (Can accept string as input - Returns 1 if the string == the title of the request, 0 otherwise)

moneyTimeout() - Returns 1 when someone doesn't hit either YES or NO and the time runs out. (Can accept string as input - Returns 1 if the string == the title of the request, 0 otherwise)

moneyClkPlayer() - Returns who pressed YES.
moneyNoClkPlayer() - Returns who pressed NO.
moneyTimeoutPlayer() - Returns who let their time run out.
ent:money() - Returns the amount of money someone has.
ent:moneyAmount() - Same as above.

Goes well with my [E2 Shipment Functions for DarkR](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217722743&tscn=1400930461) addon.
